The Amnesty International Watchdog
==================================

This project is a proof of concept prototype for a web service for internet
users at risk of being unlawfully detained. This service allows users to
voluntarily configure monitoring on their public web activity so that
notifications can be sent to their friends and family in the event of
significant change to their online usage (namely a prolonged period of
inactivity)
